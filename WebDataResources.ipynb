      "# Web APIs\n",
      "Extracting information from static web sites can be done using scraping software such as Scrapy. However, there are several disadvantages to web scraping:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Significant programming effort is required to navigate the web site and extract the information.\n",
      "1. Any change in the structure of the web pages requires updating the scraper.\n",
      "1. Dynamic pages, based on *Javascript*, of the type used in most modern web sites, are very hard to  understand and to scrape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most large internet companies provide an interface to their public information. That interface, called and **API** (Application Program Interface) or **SDK** (Software Development Kit), provide the programmer with a convenient and well documented interface for accessing the information provided by the company. \n",
      "\n",
      "A common architecture for web APIs consist of two levels:\n",
      "* An HTTP based [RESTful API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) (REST is the acronim for Representational-State-Transfer). This protocol defines URLs for requesting information and the format of the response, which is usually a JSON or and XML packet. \n",
      "* A language specific library (for Python, Ruby, Java, PERL, C# or other languages) which provides a *Wrapper* around the RESTful API. Using the language wrapper is generally preferable because it insulates the application code from changes in the RESTful layer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The benefit to the company providing the API is that by making it easy to interface with it's databases it encourages third party software houses to build extensions and enhancement to the ccompanies basic offering. In that way increasing the size of the consumer market without taking on development risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the APIs defined below are for the Python wrapper. In some cases, such as Yelp, only a Restful API is available, and some example code using this API is given."

Similar collections exist for other countries: for example the [UK](http://data.gov.uk/) and [India](http://data.gov.in/).
